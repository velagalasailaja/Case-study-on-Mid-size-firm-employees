On the contrary, if the analysis discovers anything positive, the CEO plans to reward/ acknowledge the concerned personnel/ Department leads.

Understanding:Based on the clients requirements, we need to perform some quantitative analysis to know more about the employees and  performance in several aspects.By keeping in the view of companyâ€™s productivity and growth, we need to identify the indicators of future risk if any before things go worse.

Approach:
-Splitting the given data into current working employees and Terminated employees.
-We will work on identifying the performance score and engagement in work of the current working employees to know about the performance of employees.
-We need to concentrate more on Termination reason of the employees and satisfaction score of their employees to improve company's policies if required
-We need to observe salary distribution of the current working employees.
-We need to identify the department / the managers with more number of projects being done so that the company can conduct recognition programmes to boost organizations reputation.
-We will try to identify if something wrong w.r.t hiring and if it posses any future risks.
